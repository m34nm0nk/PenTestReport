# PenTestReport
This is a penetration report that I wrote as part of a final project for an Ethical Hacking course

The pen test was performed on a Metasploitable machine and does not represent exploitation of all vulnerabilities

Exploits were performed on vsftpd 2.3.4, Samba, and priv esc via a udev process

Enjoy!
